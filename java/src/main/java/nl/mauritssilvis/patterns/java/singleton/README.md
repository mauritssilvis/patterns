# Patterns > Java > Singleton

> The singleton design pattern, implemented in Java

## Introduction

With this part of the [Patterns > Java](../../../../../../../..) project, I provide implementations of the singleton design pattern in Java.

In what follows, I give an overview of [sound](#1-implementations) and [faulty](#2-faulty-implementations) implementations.

For general information about the singleton design pattern, refer to the [singleton section](../../../../../../../../../#311-singleton) of the [Patterns](../../../../../../../../..) project.
